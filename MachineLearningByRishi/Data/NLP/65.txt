Nintendo Shares Jump After Switch Sets U.S. Sales Records: Nintendo Co. shares jumped as much as 4 percent after the company said its new Switch console is off to a record-setting pace in the U.S. since its March 3 debut. The new device sold 906,000 units in North America during March, according to industry researcher NPD Group. That means the gaming machine  sold faster in its launch month than any other video game system in Nintendo history,  according to Nintendo. The Switch has received praise for its console-tablet hybrid design that lets gamers play both in the living room and outside the house. While its limited software lineup and limited graphics ability have been criticized, demand has consistently outstripped supply during the first six weeks of sales. That s buoyed investors who think the Switch is on track to become a bigger hit than the Wii, the company s best-selling home console of all-time.
