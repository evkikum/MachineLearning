Expedia and Amazon Double Down on Britain: As politicians and businesses wrestle with potential changes to U.K. border controls, one of the world s largest online travel booking companies has decided to add hundreds of new staff in London, and it s not alone in looking to expand. Expedia Inc. will expand its U.K. office by 138,000 square feet, or to roughly twice the size of its existing space, and has signed a new lease that runs until 2030, according to a company statement. The company currently has about 1,400 staff at its London hub. Amazon.com Inc. is also hiring for its U.K.-based voice-recognition technology, cloud computing centers and Prime Air division, it said in a statement. The moves come as the U.K technology industry frets about the fallout from the nation s decision to leave the European Union by 2019, even as global tech companies continue to consider London the region s major hub.
