Lyft Gets $500 Million in New Funding as Its Rival Uber Wobbles: For years, Lyft has trailed its larger rival Uber in the battle to conquer the ride-hailing market. More recently, Lyft has gotten a boost. The smaller ride-hailing company has secured up to $500 million in a new round of funding that values Lyft at $6.9 billion before the addition of new capital, according to two people briefed on the discussions, who asked to remain anonymous because the details were confidential. The privately held company may raise an additional $100 million, these people said. The financing gave Lyft a $2.4 billion increase in value since the company last raised money in 2016. It was not immediately clear which investors were participating in the new financing. Lyft s previous investors included the venture capital firm Andreessen Horowitz and Chinese e-commerce company Alibaba. Lyft is being bolstered by the woes at Uber, which has been dealing with scandals involving the company s workplace culture and aggressive leadership team. A grass-roots movement to boycott Uber has sprung up around the country, with the hashtag #deleteuber spreading quickly across Twitter related to the company s shortcomings.
