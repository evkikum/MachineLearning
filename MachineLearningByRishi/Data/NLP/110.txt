Dyson's Latest Cordless Vacuums Drive Sales Past $3 Billion: Dyson Ltd. continues to prove making high-priced vacuum cleaners is a lucrative and growing business.The closely held U.K. firm said total sales grew 45 percent in 2016, to 2.5 billion pounds ($3.12 billion), largely due to demand for a new line of battery-powered cordless cleaners. The models, first introduced two years ago and costing about 500 pounds each, are the fastest-selling vacuums in the company s 25-year history. Dyson s profit excluding some costs surged 41 percent to 631 million pounds.The new vacuum design moves the device s motor to near the hand grip, allowing it to double as a traditional upright vacuum or a handheld cleaner to suck up debris in harder-to-reach spaces. Dyson, with about 3,500 employees, has for years been expanding beyond vacuum cleaners, with air purifiers, heaters, fans and robots. A new hair dryerthat took four years and $70 million to develop was introduced last year. The company has committed to spending 2.5 billion pounds on future technologies, including artificial intelligence and robotics. Among Dyson s biggest bets are batteries. Last year, the company said it would spend 1 billion pounds on research over the next five years. In 2015, it acquired the maker of solid state batteries Sakti3 for $90 million.
