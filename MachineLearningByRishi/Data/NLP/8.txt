Paytm raises $1.4 billion from SoftBank, valuation soars to $7 billion: Paytm has raised $1.4 billion from SoftBank Group Corp. in the largest funding round by a single investor in India, making the digital payments firm the Japanese company s biggest bet in India s start-up ecosystem. The deal includes $400 million worth of shares that SoftBank will buy largely from Paytm s early investor SAIF Partners in a secondary transaction, and a minor stake from founder Vijay Shekhar Sharma, according to two persons close to the development. The deal values the company at about $7 billion post-money (including the investment) and will take SoftBank s stake to about 20%, the two people said, requesting anonymity. Paytm, India s second-most valuable internet firm, will use the money to acquire 500 million new customers and launch a slew of financial services products such as wealth management, insurance and deposits and loans.  This business will require a lot of capital before it can start generating cash and hence we need long-term investors like SoftBank and Alibaba,  founder Sharma said in a telephone interview.
