Dubai is planning to launch autonomous, one-passenger drone taxis this summer: Pilotless drones capable of carrying a person will begin to soar through Dubai s airspace this July, according to an announcement made Monday by Mattar Al Tayer, the chief of Dubai s Roads & Transportation Agency, at the World Government Summit. The country is turning to a Chinese-made drone, the Ehang 184, which can carry a passenger weighing up to 220 pounds for about a 30-minute trip. The egg-shaped aircraft hovers using eight propellers   two attached to each of the drone s four arms. Test flights have already been conducted in Dubai, and the taxi service is expected to launch in July, says Al Tayer.
