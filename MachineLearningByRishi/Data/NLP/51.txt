Why Facebook Keeps Beating Every Rival: It s the Network, of Course: Facebook barged into Snapchat s happy Venice Beach, Calif., mansion, took a solid inventory of the goods, then lifted the crown jewels. First a version of Stories, the fun slide-show format that Snapchat created, appeared last year on Instagram, owned by Facebook. Then Snapchat s features made their way to WhatsApp and Messenger, Facebook s chat apps. A couple of weeks ago they got to the big leagues   Facebook s main app   and the heist was complete. On Tuesday, the leader of the Facebook crew, Mark Zuckerberg, put on a conference to show off his loot. But he went further: He unveiled a vision of augmented reality   in which digital objects and effects are overlaid on images of the real world   which could undercut Snapchat s mission to become the camera company for the next generation. For years now, the world has been doubting Mr. Zuckerberg. Facebook, they said, would never beat Myspace. Then Facebook was going to get a run for its money from every other social network   Twitter, Pinterest and more. Hey, could it survive Google s onslaught  Could it survive its own initial public offering  How would Facebook adjust to mobile  What about live video  And then there was Snapchat. By turning the smartphone camera into a communications platform, Snapchat created a novel and compelling social experience. Teenagers couldn t get enough of it. And teenagers are the future. If Facebook lost teenagers, game over. Do you know what happens when you control four of the biggest social networks in the world  You get to stop worrying about competitors beating you on features.
