Fitbit's Sales Plummet as Device's Popularity Fades: Fitbit Inc. s fourth-quarter revenue fell 19 percent, hurt by fading consumer demand for its once-popular wearable fitness trackers. Revenue in the quarter -- which includes the holiday shopping season -- dropped to $573.8 million, the company said Wednesday in a statement. Fitbit in Januaryhad forecast sales of $572 million to $580 million. Before then, analysts had been predicting $736.4 million, the average of estimates compiled by Bloomberg. The company s loss excluding certain costs was 56 cents a share. Analysts on average had projected a loss of 53 cents a share. Chief Executive Officer James Park has been trying to prove that Fitbit is more than just a maker of trendy gadgets. The appeal of its wristbands has waned with consumers as the company faces competition from Apple Inc. s higher-end watch and cheaper Chinese models, and last month Fitbit said it would eliminate 6 percent of its workforce. Park is seeking to diversify the business, including expanding into the smartwatch category and pushing its corporate-wellness offerings. His goal is to turn Fitbit into a digital-health company -- one that relies less on consumers and focuses on selling to the health-care industry -- but that strategy will take years to unfold.
