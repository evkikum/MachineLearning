Amazon delays its entry into Southeast Asia: Amazon has postponed its much-anticipated entry into Southeast Asia. The company initially planned to launch local e-commerce services in Singapore during the first quarter of this year, as we reported in November, but two sources with knowledge of the plans told TechCrunch that the schedule has slipped to  later this year . The Singapore launch project has been fairly guarded within Amazon itself, details of the initiative are not widely known by Amazon staff in the region, but it appears that the groundwork required to set its business up has taken longer than the company originally anticipated. In an interesting recent twist, it looks like Amazon is gearing up to launch in Australia first. A Twitter account associated with the U.S. firm this week teased an imminent launch, while ABC News reported that Amazon has hired a team of over 100 in Sydney to kick things off. Nonetheless, Amazon s eventual entry to Southeast Asia will create a new front for its battle with Alibaba, which purchased a major share in regional e-commerce firm Lazada for $1 billion last year and is already fighting Amazon in India, where it has a major stake in e-commerce and payments firm Paytm.
