Zenefits Cuts 45% of Staff as New CEO Pushes Changes: Zenefits announced it will cut 45 percent of its workforce as new Chief Executive Officer Jay Fulcher reduces costs in the wake of regulatory scrutiny and management shakeups that collapsed the company s expansion plans.The 430 job cuts announced Thursday are the third round of staff reductions for the human resources software maker in the past year amid investigations that found some employees used software to skirt training requirements and sold health insurance without the necessary licenses. Zenefits agreed in November to pay as much as $7 million to the state of California over licensing violations. Thursday s staff cuts are companywide and affect all departments, Zenefits said. The job reductions were reported earlier by BuzzFeed. The closely held San Francisco-based company hired too many employees in 2015 to sustain its revenue projections, Fulcher said in a memo to the staff.
