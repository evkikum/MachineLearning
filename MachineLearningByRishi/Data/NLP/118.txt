Google Ad Crisis Spreads as Biggest Marketers Halt Spending: Google s advertising crisis went global after some of the biggest marketers including AT&T Inc. and Johnson & Johnson halted spending on YouTube and the internet company s display network, citing concern their ads would run alongside offensive videos.The controversy erupted last week after the London-based Times newspaper reported that some ads were running with YouTube videos that promoted terrorism or anti-Semitism. The U.K. government and the Guardian newspaper took down ads from the video site and Havas SA, the world s sixth-largest advertising and marketing company, pulled its U.K. clients  ads from Google s display ad network and YouTube. On Wednesday, the boycott spread across the Atlantic as U.S. companies that are among the heaviest ad spenders pulled back, potentially costing Google and YouTube hundreds of millions of dollars in lost business. AT&T and Verizon Communications Inc., the largest U.S. wireless carriers, said they had stopped non-search advertising spending with Google. Johnson & Johnson, the world s biggest health-care company, paused all YouTube advertising globally.
