Ant Financial Said Considering Higher Offer for MoneyGram: Billionaire Jack Ma s Ant Financial is considering whether to make a higher offer for MoneyGram International Inc., according to a person familiar with the negotiations, after the U.S. company said a smaller rival s bid could be a better deal. In January, China-based Ant Financial announced its plan to acquire MoneyGram for $13.25 a share in cash, pending regulatory approval. Last week, Euronet Worldwide Inc. swooped in with a $15.20-a-share offer, a proposition that  could reasonably be expected  to result in a superior proposal, Dallas-based MoneyGram said Monday in a statement. Douglas Feagin, Ant s head of international operations, said he s  confident  that the deal will go through. It s likely that Ant Financial will either counter the bid with a higher offer, or say that it will wait until Euronet finishes carrying out its due diligence before delivering a rival bid, according to a person familiar with the negotiations. If MoneyGram declares Euronet s bid superior, Ant will have four days to respond. MoneyGram s shares rose 0.9 percent to $16.43 at the close in New York. They have more than doubled in the past year.
