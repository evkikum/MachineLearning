SpaceX Plans to Send 2 Tourists Around Moon in 2018: SpaceX, the ambitious rocket company headed by Elon Musk, wants to send a couple of tourists around the moon and back before the end of next year. If they manage that feat, they would be the first humans to venture that far into space in more than 40 years. Mr. Musk made the announcement on Monday in a telephone news conference. He said two private individuals approached the company to see if SpaceX would be willing to send them on a weeklong cruise, which would fly past the surface of the moon   but not land   and continue outward before Earth s gravity turned the spacecraft around and brought it back for a landing.  This would do a long loop around the moon,  Mr. Musk said. The company is aiming to launch this moon mission in late 2018, he said. The two people would spend about a week inside one of SpaceX s Dragon 2 capsules, launched on SpaceX s Falcon Heavy rocket. The spacecraft would be automated, but the travelers would undergo training for emergencies, Mr. Musk said. He did not say how much the travelers would pay for the ride, but the Falcon Heavy itself has a list price of $90 million. He said the two would-be private space travelers wished to remain anonymous for now, and he declined to describe them except to say that they knew each other. In response to a reporter s question, Mr. Musk did say the two were not Hollywood people.
