Airbnb Wants to Spend Some of the $3 Billion It s Sitting On: Airbnb Inc. is on a mission to be more than a home-sharing platform. It wants to be a flight booker, an itinerary planner and a vacation-home manager. To become a global travel behemoth, Airbnb is considering a combination of acquisitions and partnership deals to quickly grow its portfolio, according to three people with knowledge of Airbnb's plans. The company's targets are in luxury tourism, airfare aggregation, group payments and guest-management, said the people, who asked not to be identified because Airbnb hasn't authorized them to speak publicly. Airbnb is also focused on doing deals in China and India, the people said. On Thursday, Bloomberg reported that Airbnb's board met to approve the purchase of Luxury Retreats, a vacation-home management company in Montreal. The sale is expected to garner no more than $300 million in cash and stock. Airbnb is also in the process of purchasing the group-payments company Tilt. Airbnb declined to comment on the deals because they are not yet public.  New product categories would generate alternative revenue sources for Airbnb. Over the last few years, after pressure from regulators, Airbnb agreed to place limits on how long hosts can rent their homes to travelers in certain cities. Officials in London, New York, Amsterdam, San Francisco and Barcelona have claimed Airbnb s short-term rentals violate local zoning laws and displace long-term residents. The policymakers continue to seek laws that could place considerable restrictions on Airbnb s money-making ability. Airbnb became profitable in the second half of 2016, when revenue at the company increased more than 80 percent that year, Bloomberg reported. Airbnb expects to remain profitable in 2017.
