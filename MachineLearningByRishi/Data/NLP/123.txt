What happened to tablet sales  In the past month, both Apple and Samsung have refreshed their flagship tablets for the first time since 2014. A lot has changed in the space in the intervening years   mostly for the worse, as overall sales have continued to slip. In Q4 of last year, IDC reported that shipments had dropped 20 percent, year over year, while Strategic Analytics has the number at half that. There s room for debate as far as precisely how down the overall market is (not to mention what precisely qualifies a device as a tablet), but there seems to at least be a consensus that early predictions of the tablet space eclipsing PCs missed the mark. The space has suffered for a variety of reasons. Among them, the fact that users simply aren t refreshing tablets at a rate many manufacturers no doubt predicted.  The iPad 2 is still in use today,  IDC Senior Analyst Jitesh Ubrani tells TechCrunch.  The [original] iPad Minis and Air are all still in use today. They were being supported by Apple until very recently. People have been hanging onto these devices and they re finding that they work just as well as they did when they were released.  There are a few reasons for this. For one thing, users haven t been conditioned to upgrade slates on the same cycle as smartphone   something that s been hammered into consumers in almost Pavlovian fashion through carrier upgrade cycles. There s also the simple fact that we tend not to put the devices through the same sort of day to day wear and tear of smartphones, or even laptops, with many users simply leaving their devices at home and breaking them out when it s time to watch some Netflix. The growing size of smartphone displays has gone a ways toward cannibalizing tablet sales, as well, limiting the need for a much larger device when so many handsets are now within the six-inch range.
