Twitter plans to trim down its ads products: Twitter continues to bleed cash and its advertising business has begun shrinking, so it s time for a change. Twitter will pare down three areas of its ad product, according to sources who spoke to TechCrunch. Twitter foreshadowed the shift during last week s lackluster earnings report that showed a year-over-year decline in Q4 ad revenue, from $641 million in 2015 to $638 million in 2016. Meanwhile it saw little growth in monthly active users (currently 319 million, up 4 percent year-on-year). That added up to a $167 million loss last quarter. Together these facts underscore a critical issue for the company: It has yet to find the right formula for products that attract both users and revenues. But Twitter is trying to course-correct, and its solution is two-fold: it s redefined itself around a core mission   last week described as  the best and fastest place to see what s happening in the world and what people are talking about,  and, TechCrunch has learned, it s looking at ways of paring down its ad business to have more focus, too. Three areas that Twitter is reassessing include the company s direct response business, aspects of the Promoted Tweets products and the legacy TellApart business. Twitter has not shuttered any of these yet, but from what we understand, it is now concentrating on what is driving more revenues. If there are products that are not getting significant buy-in from advertisers (say hundreds of millions in revenue), Twitter wants to stop supporting them.
