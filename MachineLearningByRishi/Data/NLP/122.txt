Pinterest expects to make more than $500 million in revenue this year: Pinterest may finally be growing into its $11 billion valuation. Pinterest, which makes all of its money from advertising, is targeting more than $500 million in revenue in 2017, according to multiple sources familiar with the company s plans. Some believe the company could generate as much as $600 million this year. Even on the low end of that range, that would be a jump of at least 67 percent over the $300 million in revenue Pinterest brought in last year, when it had internal goals to bring in $1 million per day. The company generated $100 million in revenue in 2015. Pinterest s business is still relatively new. The company is in its third full year selling advertising and has just one ad product, Promoted Pins, which let advertisers push their posts to users who may not follow them on the service. But those close to the company believe Pinterest is on the path to an IPO. Sources say Pinterest won t IPO  soon  but that it s currently putting the pieces in place. The company hired its first CFO, Todd Morgenfeld, from Twitter back in October, and has Facebook s former monetization director, Tim Kendall, overseeing all of Pinterest's revenue efforts, among other things. Those close to Pinterest believe that if Snap, which generated roughly $400 million in revenue the year before its IPO and shares tens of millions in revenue with media partners, can fetch a valuation north of $20 billion on the public markets, Pinterest is in good shape to do something similar.
