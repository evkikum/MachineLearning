Theranos is offering investors Elizabeth Holmes  shares if they promise not to sue: One way Theranos is hoping to stay afloat is by offering double the shares   including some of founder Elizabeth Holmes  own shares   to investors if they promise not to sue. Theranos is knee-deep in an avalanche of lawsuits from investors and consumers of its blood-testing products after it was discovered last year the tests had an accuracy problem and didn t meet with the company s own standards. Its main partner, Walgreens, has since pulled out and is also suing the company. According to The Wall Street Journal, Theranos  board approved a move in February to shuffle shares, including from founder Elizabeth Holmes, to investors as a way to appease them. It s not clear how many shares Holmes is offering up herself, but at least a couple of investors aren t taking the deal. Theranos has reached a separate agreement with Rupert Murdoch, the executive chairman of News Corp and 21st Century Fox Inc., who refused to agree to the same deal as other investors   possibly for tax reasons. Theranos will instead buy back his shares for $1, according to the Journal s sources. Another investor, San Francisco-based hedge fund Partner Fund Management LP, which sued Theranos in October and participated in the $198 Series C round attributed to have driven Theranos to its former $9 billion valuation, also refused the agreement.
