Amazon adds video calling with Echo Show: Amazon.com Inc launched Echo Show, a touchscreen device that will allow users to video call and watch clips from CNN, the latest in the company's series of popular Echo voice-controlled speakers. The device, which will go on sale in June for about $230, will feature Alexa, Amazon's voice-controlled aide, that can be used to play music, order an Uber or turn on the house lights. Echo Show will allow video conferencing between users having an Echo device or the Alexa app. It is the first to support the feature, which is absent in similar devices offered by rivals such as Alphabet Inc's unit Google.
