YouTube unveils YouTube TV, its live TV streaming service: After a year of rumors, YouTube is finally drawing back the curtain on its latest play for entertainment industry domination   a live TV service. At the company s Playa Vista offices, a crowd of roughly 100 journalists settled into tables and chairs arrayed in the company s hangar-like foyer to the strains of  Video Killed the Radio Star  and  Coffee and TV  to hear the news. (Seriously, YouTube s music game is on point). Distinct from YouTube Red, the new service, YouTube TV, which has been in the works for years at Google s internet video behemoth, has quietly been inking contracts with media companies to distribute their content on its TV service. As previously reported by The WSJ and Bloomberg News, a steady drumbeat of leaks had already set the tone for what will be offered by the service. According to Bloomberg, YouTube had been talking with all of the major networks to roll up content. CBS was the first major TV network to sign on to the service, with all of the other studios also roped into discussions including 21st Century Fox, Comcast s NBCUniversal and Disney, which owns ABC, ESPN and others.
