New details emerge about Palantir s custom software for spy agencies: A new report by The Intercept provides some compelling specifics on collaboration between Palo Alto s secretive big data shop Palantir and the intelligence agencies that it keeps on its client roster. While some broad strokes are known about Palantir s relationship with spy agencies, the finer points seldom see daylight. That guarantee of secrecy no doubt aids the company s growth into 2017, though its cozy relationship with a presidency keen on implementing aggressive policies with big opportunities for big data certainly can t hurt, either. The report goes into more detail on the development of two particular software systems, one called Kite and one known as XKEYSCORE Helper. Through Kite, implemented by GCHQ, Palantir offered deep customization:  Out of the box, Kite was able to handle a variety of types of data (including dates, images, geolocations, etc.), but GCHQ was free to extend it by writing custom fields for complicated types of data the agency might need to analyze. The import tools were designed to handle a variety of use cases, including static data sets, databases that were updated frequently, and data stores controlled by third parties to which GCHQ was able to gain access.  Designed in apparent collaboration with Palantir, XKEYSCORE Helper sought to make data obtained through the NSA s muscular XKEYSCORE program more digestible and offered a way to port it into Palantir s more analyst-friendly interface:  This collaborative environment also produced a piece of software called  XKEYSCORE Helper,  a tool programmed with Palantir (and thoroughly stamped with its logo) that allowed analysts to essentially import data from the NSA s pipeline, investigate and visualize it through Palantir, and then presumably pass it to fellow analysts or Five Eyes intelligence partners.
