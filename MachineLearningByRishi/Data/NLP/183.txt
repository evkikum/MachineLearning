TripAdvisor revenue misses estimates, shares slip: Travel review website TripAdvisor reported lower-than-expected quarterly revenue, hurt by a fall in display advertisements on its websites and a drop in subscription revenue. Shares of the company, which owns websites such as TripAdvisor.com and Oyster.com, fell 5.1 percent to $49.99 in extended trading on Wednesday. TripAdvisor's total revenue in the fourth quarter was $316 million. The company's revenue from display-based advertising and subscription fell 2.8 percent to $69 million. Needham, Massachusetts-based TripAdvisor, which aggregates reviews and opinions about destinations and hotels, said its referral and transaction revenue was $154 million, flat from last year. TripAdvisor's referral revenue has been under pressure since the company rolled out its instant booking feature, which allows booking of hotel rooms directly through the company's website.
