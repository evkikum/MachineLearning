Fitbit Beats Low Expectations on Stronger-Than-Expected Demand: Fitbit gave investors some much-needed good news, reporting revenue that beat projections and suggesting it s finally making progress in its transformation from a maker of step-counting gadgets to essential health-monitoring tools. The hardware maker s profitability has sagged while it confronts a maturing market and falling sales. Fitbit shares have lost more than half of their value over the past year, as investors lost patience that upcoming products would resuscitate demand. The company reported earnings that came in well-below analyst expectations the past two quarters and cut staff earlier this year to reduce operating costs. Sales fell 41 percent to $298.9 million in the quarter ended March 31, Fitbit said Wednesday in a statement. Analysts on average estimated $279.4 million, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The company said it lost 15 cents a share, excluding some costs, compared with analysts  projection of a loss of 18 cents a share. Fitbit s share gained 9.3 percent in extended trading at 4:28 p.m. in New York after closing at $5.68.
