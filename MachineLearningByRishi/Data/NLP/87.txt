Facebook's Whatsapp Is Getting Into Digital Payments in India: Facebook Inc. s WhatsApp is getting into digital payments in India, a first for a global messaging service that s only just begun to explore ways to generate revenue. It s chosen to kick off that maiden effort in India, a market dominated by Alibaba-backed digital payments leader Paytm but where WhatsApp s 200 million users outnumber any other country. WhatsApp wants to  contribute more to India s vision for digital commerce,  it said in a statement Wednesday. The company also advertised on its website for a  Digital Transactions Lead, India  to be based in Menlo Park, California, but with an ability to understand local financial standards such as India s digital-ID program Aadhaar and its banking payments interface. India is seeing unprecedented activity in digital payments, particularly since the government banned high-value currency notes in November and took a series of steps to incentivize digital payments in a country where cash remains king. Among the market s recent entrants is Sequoia Capital and Kleiner Perkins-backed Truecaller.
