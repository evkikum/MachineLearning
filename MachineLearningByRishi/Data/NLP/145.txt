Snap Shares Leap 44% in Debut as Investors Doubt Value Will Vanish: Snapchat is a business built in large part on disappearing messages and adding animated dog ears and flower crowns to users  selfies. As of Thursday, that business is worth about $34 billion   more than the market value of the old-line media company CBS, and about three times the size of another social media company, Twitter. Snapchat has made paper billionaires of its 20-something founders five times over. In making its stock market debut in spectacular fashion   its shares rising 44 percent on their first day of trading   Snapchat s parent, Snap Inc., has blazed a trail for other technology darlings like Uber and Spotify that remain privately held. It elated Wall Street institutions eager for a prominent initial public offering when few had surfaced for months. The company has entranced investors despite a litany of red flags, like enormous losses that are expected to persist for years, a slowdown in its once-vaunted user growth rates, and an ownership structure that gives Snapchat s founders control for decades to come.
