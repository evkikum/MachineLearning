Netflix shares head for new high after strong subscriber outlook: Netflix Inc made a bullish forecast for subscriber additions by mid-year, a positive sign for its push to expand around the world that sent its shares toward an all-time high. The streaming video company pushed back the next season of its smash-hit "House of Cards," and other programing to the second quarter, meaning it lured in fewer new subscribers in the first quarter than expected, but will likely make it up from April through June. Subscriber rolls, the most closely watched measure of Netflix's growth, rose by just under 5 million globally in the first quarter, behind analysts' projection of 5.18 million, according to FactSet StreetAccount. However, Netflix forecast 3.2 million more in the seasonally slow second quarter, well ahead of analysts' estimate of nearly 2.4 million. Its shares dropped as much as 3 percent in after-hours trading before rebounding to gain 1.3 percent. The late rise put Netflix stock on track to open at a record high on Tuesday. In its quarterly letter to shareholders, Netflix asked investors to judge its future success by looking primarily at revenue growth and global operating margins. That would be a shift for Wall Street, which has focused on subscriber numbers, said Needham & Co analyst Laura Martin. "The minute you actually pivot (investors) to an income statement, you're talking to a completely different kind of investor," Martin said. "And that investor demands profitability. So it's a risky business." The Los Gatos, California-based company said net income rose to $178 million, or 40 cents per share, compared with $28 million, or 6 cents per share, in the year-ago period. Revenue rose 35 percent to $2.64 billion in the quarter.
