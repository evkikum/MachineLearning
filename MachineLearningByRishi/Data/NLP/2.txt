Pittsburgh Welcomed Uber s Driverless Car Experiment. Not Anymore. When Uber picked this former Rust Belt town as the inaugural city for its driverless car experiment, Pittsburgh played the consummate host.  You can either put up red tape or roll out the red carpet,  Bill Peduto, the mayor of Pittsburgh, said in September.  If you want to be a 21st-century laboratory for technology, you put out the carpet.  Nine months later, Pittsburgh residents and officials say Uber has not lived up to its end of the bargain. Among Uber s perceived transgressions: The company began charging for driverless rides that were initially pitched as free. It also withdrew support from Pittsburgh s application for a $50 million federal grant to revamp transportation. And it has not created the jobs it proposed in a struggling neighborhood that houses its autonomous car testing track. The deteriorating relationship between Pittsburgh and Uber offers a cautionary tale, especially as other cities consider rolling out driverless car trials from Uber, Alphabet s Waymo and others.
