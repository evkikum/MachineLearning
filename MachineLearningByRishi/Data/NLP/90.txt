SoftBank moots Snapdeal sale to Flipkart, proposed deal set to be biggest in Indian e-commerce: SoftBank, the largest shareholder in Snapdeal, held boardroom discussions on the proposed sale of the online marketplace to rival Flipkart on Tuesday, according to two people aware of the development. According to the terms proposed by the Japanese media and telecom conglomerate, Snapdeal shareholders will get one share of Flipkart for every ten they own, said the people cited above. Early investors in Snapdeal   Kalaari Capital and Nexus Venture Partners   have also asked for about $100 million each from the sale, the sources said. The proposed sale could see SoftBank pick up a 20% stake in the country's largest ecommerce company for about $1.5 billion, in the process buying out $500 million to $1 billion worth of Tiger Global's holding in Flipkart, according to two people aware of the matter.  Alibaba-backed Paytm E-commerce has also discussed a potential acquisition of Snapdeal, but the valuation offered was much lower than that offered by Flipkart, added another source.  The meeting signals easing of tensions between Kalaari and Nexus, and SoftBank, said one of the sources mentioned above.
