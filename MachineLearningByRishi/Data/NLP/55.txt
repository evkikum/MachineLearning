PetSmart is acquiring Chewy.com for $3.35 billion in the largest e-commerce acquisition ever: PetSmart has agreed to make the biggest e-commerce acquisition in history, putting a deal in place to snatch up fast-growing pet food and product site Chewy.com for $3.35 billion, according to multiple sources familiar with the deal. The deal is a huge one by any standard   bigger than Walmart s $3.3 billion deal for Jet.com last year  and especially for a retail company like PetSmart, which was itself valued at only $8.7 billion when private equity investors took it over in 2015. But Chewy.com has been one of the fastest-growing e-commerce sites on the planet, registering nearly $900 million in revenue last year, in what was only its fifth year in operation. The company had been a potential IPO candidate for this year or next, but was taken out by its brick-and-mortar competitor before that. It was not profitable last year. Chewy was founded in 2011 by Ryan Cohen and Michael Day, and built a cult following for its excellent customer service, large selection and fast shipping. It had quietly raised at least $236 million in venture capital from investors including Volition Capital, T. Rowe Price and BlackRock. Its under-the-radar status was probably aided by the fact that it was headquartered in Fort Lauderdale, Florida.
