At Peter Thiel s Palantir, Allegations of Theft and Deception: Marc Abramowitz thought he d found kindred spirits in the founders of Palantir Technologies Inc. Like Chief Executive Officer Alex Karp and billionaire Chairman Peter Thiel, Abramowitz was a Stanford University alumnus looking to build a business empire. In 2006, Abramowitz made an investment in their then unknown startup and became a regular around the office. In recent years, Palantir has risen to be a global data mining giant with a $20 billion valuation. Abramowitz s shares are estimated to be worth $60 million. But his relationship with the founders has turned toxic, and they now have competing lawsuits in two states. Abramowitz s suit was filed last week in Delaware s Chancery Court, saying Palantir thwarted his efforts to sell shares and that the company must disclose its books and records. Bloomberg has obtained an unredacted copy of the suit, which hasn t been previously reported. It alleges that Palantir blocked a planned sale of Abramowitz s shares to Chinese private equity firm CDH Investments Fund Management Co. and that Palantir violated an agreement with Abramowitz to provide him with quarterly financial statements and access to shareholder meetings. Palantir, which sued Abramowitz in September for attempting to claim patent ownership for the company s work, said the new suit is without merit. It said it shouldn t have to disclose information about its inner-workings or finances because Abramowitz s interests are at odds with the company s.  This lawsuit is nothing more than a blatant attempt to distract from Mr. Abramowitz s unlawful and egregious theft of our intellectual property,  Palantir wrote in an emailed statement.
