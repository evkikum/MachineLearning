Facebook tests reactions and Dislike button (!) on messages: Facebook finally has a Dislike button, but it s not where you d expect. How do you reply to a specific message in a rapid-fire chat thread  Facebook wants you to attach emojis to your friends  messages the same way you do with News Feed posts.TechCrunch reader Hoan Do sent us a tip that Facebook Messenger is showing some users a Reactions option. When you hover over messages friends have sent in a chat thread, you can tap the emoji button to pick from attaching a little thumbs-up Like, thumbs-down Dislike, or a heart-eyes, lol, wow, sad, or angry emoji. Everyone in the thread will then see that Reaction counted below the specific message you attached it to, and you can tap to see a full list of who left which Reaction. Facebook confirmed this new feature to TechCrunch, saying  We re always testing ways to make Messenger more fun and engaging. This is a small test where we enable people to share an emoji that best represents their feelings on a message.  That means not everyone has access now, but if people enjoy it, Messenger Reactions could roll out to all users. Notably, the Messenger reaction list differs from the News Feed one because of the addition of much-requested and always-denied Dislike button. Though it s known as Facebook s most asked for feature, the company didn t want to inject too much negativity into the feed so it never built one. Instead, it built Reactions so people could share more nuanced emotions quickly, but left disliking for the comments. Facebook launched Reactions almost exactly a year ago, and they proven popular, with over 300 billion sent so far.  Love  is the most frequently used, making up more than half of all Reactions.
