Infosys Founders Said to Question Payments for CEO, Managers: The board of Infosys Ltd., India s second-largest technology services company, is facing questions over executive compensation and corporate governance in a letter sent by at least three of its founders, according to people with knowledge of the matter. Narayana Murthy, Nandan Nilekani and Kris Gopalakrishnan have signed the document asking why Chief Executive Officer Vishal Sikka s compensation was increased, said one of the people, who asked not to be identified discussing the contents of a private memo. Sikka was paid 487 million rupees ($7.3 million) in base salary, bonus and benefits last year, compared with a base salary of 45.6 million rupees for a partial period in 2015. The letter also questioned severance packages offered to two top-level executives who departed the company. Infosys shares listed in New York rose 3.3 percent to close at $14.57, the highest in a month. The stock declined 11 percent in 2016. Infosys s revenue is projected to climb 10 percent in the current fiscal year, compared with 17 percent prior, as clients cut back on spending. Cloud-computing and automation of information-technology tasks are disrupting Infosys s business model of charging man hours for application development, infrastructure maintenance and other work that keeps corporate computer systems and networks up and running.  Infosys is behaving in a much more non-transparent manner than in the past,  said Shriram Subramanian, managing director of corporate governance researcher InGovern.  At the same time, Infosys  co-founders seem unable to cut off their umbilical cord with the company.
