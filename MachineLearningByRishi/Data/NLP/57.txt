Trump will sign an executive order reviewing high-skilled H-1B immigration visas: U.S. President Donald Trump will order a full review of the country s high-skilled immigration visa program tomorrow, part of a continued push to clamp down on companies   including, potentially, some in the tech industry   that hire foreigners instead of Americans. In a forthcoming executive order, Trump will commission the Department of Homeland Security, which issues the popular H-1B visa, to review the way they are rewarded. The agency is also instructed to suggest reforms so that visas only land in the hands of highly paid, specially skilled applicants, and not foreign workers who might be paid less than their U.S. counterparts. On its face, Trump s new directive   a push to  buy American, hire American,  as his aides described it today   does not change the immediate day-to-day working of the H-1B system, which many companies in Silicon Valley support. Instead, at least for the moment, it only opens a formal review of the program. Still, Trump s move may leave many wary in the tech industry, as it s the latest in a line of restrictions and changes the administration has introduced to the high-skilled foreign worker visa in recent weeks.
