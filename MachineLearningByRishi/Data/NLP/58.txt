Batteries could be Tesla s secret weapon: Markets are very optimistic about Tesla s future   so optimistic that it would be impossible to explain if Tesla were a conventional car company. On paper, Tesla shouldn t be worth anywhere near as much as rivals like Ford and GM. Ford sold 6.6 million cars in 2016. GM sold 10 million. Tesla sold a paltry 76,000. Ford and GM both turned healthy profits in 2016. Tesla lost money. Yet earlier this month Tesla s market value surged past Ford and then briefly eclipsed GM as America s most valuable carmaker. One big reason for this is that Tesla has made a risky bet on batteries that could be on the verge of a huge payoff. Because Tesla cars are purely electric, a single car needs about 1,000 times as much battery capacity as a typical smartphone. So making electric cars a mainstream technology will require producing batteries on a scale that dwarfs today s production for smartphones and other portable gadgets. A major test of this will come in Tesla s release of the Model 3 later this year. These cars will be powered by batteries from the Gigafactory, a huge factory Tesla has constructed in the Nevada desert. If the Model 3 is a hit, experts say, the Gigafactory will ensure Tesla has plenty of batteries to meet demand for this relatively affordable mass-market vehicle. Other car companies would have to scramble   not only to design a similar stylish vehicle, but also to find suppliers for yet more batteries. Experts say this battery advantage won t last forever   other battery makers might be able to catch up within a year or two. But having a year or two head start could make a big difference   not only cementing Tesla s reputation as the leading electric car brand, but positioning Tesla to make further investments that could help it stay a step ahead of rivals down the road.
