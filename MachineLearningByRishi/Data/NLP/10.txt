Cisco revenue forecast disappoints; says to cut 1,100 more jobs: Cisco forecast current-quarter revenue that widely missed analysts' estimates and said it would cut 1,100 more jobs, as the world's largest networking gear maker steps up efforts to transform into a software-focused company. Shares of the Dow component fell 8.2 percent to $31.05 in after-market trading on Wednesday. The stock had closed down 1.4 percent in regular trading, compared with the 1.78 percent slump in the index. Revenue in its closely-watched security business, which offers firewall protection and breach detection systems, rose 9 percent to $527 million, but missed analysts' estimate of $545.5 million, according to financial data and analytics firm FactSet Street Account. Cisco, like other legacy technology players, is shifting its focus to high-growth areas such as security, the Internet of Things and cloud computing, amid intense competition from companies such as Huawei and Juniper. The company's net income rose to $2.52 billion, or 50 cents per share, in the third quarter ended April 29 from $2.35 billion, or 46 cents per share, a year earlier. Revenue fell 0.5 percent to $11.94 billion.
