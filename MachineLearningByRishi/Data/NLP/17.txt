Netmarble Soars as Korea s Biggest IPO in Seven Years Takes Wing: Netmarble Games Corp. jumped as investors pursuing a high-growth alternative to traditional industry piled into South Korea s biggest coming-out party in seven years. Shares in the mobile game developer and publisher climbed as high as 171,500 won in early Seoul trade, 9.2 percent above their initial public offering price, to give the company a market value of more than 14 trillion won ($12.5 billion), surpassing LG Electronics Inc. Founded in 2000 by high-school dropout Bang Jun-hyuk, Netmarble is a rare entrepreneurial success in a nation dominated by politically connected manufacturing conglomerates. Betting smartphones would drive gaming, Bang built the company into one of Asia s largest publishers of mobile titles such as Lineage 2 Revolution, and won backing from China s Tencent Holdings Ltd. A successful debut could inspire a generation of talent in a country whose conglomerates have been accused of stifling innovation.  Investors bought in despite the stock trading at valuations well above its rivals: Netmarble was priced at more than 70 times 2016 earnings, surpassing NCSoft Corp. s roughly 29 times and Nexon Co. s 45 times as of Thursday s close. It also faces stiffening competition, with NCSoft releasing a role-playing series this year to directly challenge Lineage 2 Revolution.
