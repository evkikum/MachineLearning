Yelp is getting eviscerated after it toned down its expectations for the year: Yelp shares are down more than 25 percent after the company reported its first-quarter earnings report today, where it reduced its full-year guidance that it set in the previous quarter. The company said it would bring in between $850 million and $865 million in revenue for the full fiscal year of 2017. In the fourth quarter (reported in February), Yelp said net revenue was expected to be in the range of $880 million to $900 million. That means even though the company s revenue fell only a little short of what Wall Street was expecting, the company is signaling slower growth than expected. Yelp has seen slowing revenue growth for some time now. If the company itself is paring back its growth expectations, that means it s trying to set some model closer to reality for Wall Street   which is inevitably going to make industry observers reset their own models, and the valuation for the company along with it. Before today s fall off a cliff, Yelp was valued at around $2.8 billion.
