Alphabet s self-driving unit Waymo is teaming up with Lyft: Waymo, the self-driving unit of Google parent company Alphabet, is teaming up with Lyft to work on bringing autonomous vehicle efforts to market, the New York Times reports. Details on what this partnership entails remain a little fuzzy, but sources told Times reporter Mike Isaac the two companies would be working together on pilot projects and product development efforts. That's another way of saying Lyft users in some markets will likely be able to hail a Waymo self-driving car in a limited test sometime down the road. This is not Lyft s only partnership aimed at bringing self-driving technology into the mainstream. Lyft has a partnership with GM, which last year acquired self-driving startup Cruise. Alphabet was also experimenting with its own ride-hailing app   which the company has been using in its first pilot program in Arizona. But it's not likely the company would solely depend on either that app or the ride-matching service Waze, another Alphabet subsidiary, has been experimenting with to give consumers access to self-driving cars. That s largely due to the difficulty of gaining market share in the already crowded ride-hail industry   an issue Lyft, the perennial runner up to Uber, knows all too well. The relationship between Uber and Alphabet has gone from tense to combative in the past year. It was long-rumored that the two players would work together on an network of autonomous cars but Uber decided to navigate that road on its own making a competitor of Alphabet as both companies vyed for automaker partnerships. This is just the latest in a series of blows to Uber s and Waymo s once potentially fruitful relationship.
