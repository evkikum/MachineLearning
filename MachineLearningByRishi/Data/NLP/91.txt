Troubled Chinese Giant LeEco Said to Delay Paying U.S. Employees: Chinese technology conglomerate LeEco Inc. delayed payroll for U.S. employees this month, people familiar with the matter said, another sign that billionaire Jia Yueting s media and Internet empire is grappling with a cash squeeze. LeEco s U.S. employees are normally paid on the 15th and last day of every month, but the company has told employees that March 31 paychecks would be delayed until April 4, the people said, asking not to be identified discussing private matters. LeEco told employees in the U.S. the delay was due to issues with moving money from China, according to one of the people. After rapid expansion of his tech empire, Jia admitted late last year that the company was struggling to raise cash. Some suppliers said that LeEco was behind on payments and the company was stripped of some sports broadcasting rights after defaulting. The paycheck delays are stoking frustration at a U.S. operation that s suffered key executive departures in the last few months. Jia said in October that LeEco employs more than 500 people in the country  with more being added each week,  but the company hasn t disclosed its latest U.S. headcount.
