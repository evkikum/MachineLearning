Samsung Withstands Scandals to Report Higher Profit, Revenue: Samsung Electronics Co. posted its best operating profit in almost four years on robust sales of memory chips and displays, showing that the core businesses remain stable even as its mobile unit recovers from a costly recall and the trial of the group s de facto chief. Operating income rose 48 percent to 9.9 trillion won ($8.74 billion) in the three months ended March, the Suwon, South Korea-based company said in preliminary resultsreleased Friday. That compares with the 9.18 trillion-won average of analysts  estimatescompiled by Bloomberg. Rising demand for memory chips and organic light-emitting diode screens helped to fuel a rise in sales to 50 trillion won in the quarter, compared with the 49.5 trillion won analysts expected. The results also underscore how the electronics conglomerate is recovering from last year s Note 7 crisis, when some smartphones burst into flames and forced Samsung to pull it from shelves. That was followed by the arrest of de facto chief Jay Y. Lee in February in connection with an influence-peddling scandal. Samsung s shares fell less than 1 percent in Seoul. They have climbed about 16 percent this year and are trading near record highs.
