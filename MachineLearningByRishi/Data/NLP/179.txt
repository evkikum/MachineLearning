Snapdeal s cash squeeze adds to funding pressure: Jasper Infotech which runs Snapdeal, had about Rs1,100-1,200 crore cash left in the bank and Rs300-400 crore at its payments unit Freecharge at the end of 2016, making it critical for the company to secure funds immediately, according to official documents and three people familiar with the matter. Snapdeal has gone into cash-conserve mode after talks for a bridge round of funding with existing investor SoftBank were deferred because of differences over valuation, the three people cited above said. Snapdeal is still in talks with at least two other existing investors, the people said, declining to be identified. Snapdeal s dwindling cash reserves crimp its ability to compete with rivals Flipkart, Amazon and Paytm and also raise questions about how long it can survive without fresh capital.
