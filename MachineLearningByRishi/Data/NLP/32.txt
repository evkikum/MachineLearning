Square Thrives as Payments Platform Woos Bigger Merchants: Square Inc. is on a roll, proving that it s not just a niche payments player but an all-inclusive business management platform for small companies. Run by Twitter Inc. Chief Executive Officer Jack Dorsey, Square has come a long way from its early days as a credit card reader in food trucks. It s been expanding geographically and in terms of the services it offers merchants, winning bigger clients as a result and boosting sales. Revenue in the first quarter shot past forecasts from the company and analysts, rising 39 percent as businesses sign on for payments processing, loans and software to help manage inventory. Square also raised its sales and profit forecast for the year. Not long ago investors had begun to question Square s prospects and growth in the face of rising competition from PayPal Holdings Inc. and Apple Pay. But the San Francisco-based company has plowed ahead, marking its biggest international push by launching services in the U.K. in March, and signing partnerships and acquisitions in the food-delivery business, a strategy it hopes helps attract more restaurants. Earlier this year, Square introduced a set of business tools aimed specifically at retailers, which accounted for 20 percent of all payments volume it processed last year. The efforts haven t gone unnoticed, as investors pushed the stock to a record $18.81 on Tuesday. Square gained 5.4 percent at 5:28 p.m. in extended trading in New York Wednesday.
