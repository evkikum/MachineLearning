Infosys, an Indian Outsourcing Company, Says It Will Create 10,000 U.S. Jobs: Facing new corporate demands and political pressure from a Trump administration that wants to curb immigrant work visas, Infosys, one of India s leading tech outsourcing companies, said Tuesday that it will hire up to 10,000 Americans to serve its clients in the United States. The move makes Infosys the latest Asian technology company to portray itself as a jobs creator as President Trump threatens to take action against companies he sees as hurting American workers. Last month, Mr. Trump signed an executive order directing government agencies to review employment immigration laws to promote  Hire American  policies. That included offering suggestions for how to reform the H-1B visa program, which operates as a lottery to bring skilled foreign laborers to the United States each year   usually tech workers. But Infosys is also making its move to hire American driven by other forces. Its home base of India has become a less appealing place to do the grunt work of programming as wages rise there and skilled labor has become more difficult to find. A study of 36,000 engineering students at 500 Indian colleges released last month found that only 5 percent could write software code correctly.
