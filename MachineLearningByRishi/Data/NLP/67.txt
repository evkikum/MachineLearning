Google Home has stopped answering to that annoying Burger King ad: The internet barely had time to be annoyed for that new 15 second Burger King ad before Google shut the whole thing down. A little over two hours after the fast food giant took the wraps off of a TV spot designed to trigger smart assistants across the country, the functionality no longer works. We ve reached out to Google for confirmation of the action, which was likely just a quick fix on the server side designed to block a specific waveform, perhaps leveraging similar functionality to block out its own ads. Meantime, we ve tried in out on a Home unit we have around the office and can confirm that the commercial no longer has the intended effect. Interestingly, it s not the specific function, just the voice from the ad. Asking Home what a  Whopper sandwich  is in your own voice (like a Big Mac, but smaller) will bring up the Wikipedia entry as initially intended. For Google, the fix is likely akin to patching a security flaw (though here it s more about annoyance than any real security threat).
