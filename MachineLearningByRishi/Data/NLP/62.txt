Uber Wants to Rule the World. First It Must Conquer India.  After last year s bruising retreat from China, where the company was outgunned by local incumbent Didi Chuxing, Uber is diving fully into this nation of 1.3 billion people, pouring money, engineers and logistical expertise into dominating what could one day be the world s largest market for transportation services. Back at Uber s headquarters in San Francisco in January, Mr. Kalanick, sitting at the head of a small conference table, offered a proud assessment of his company s role in India. Sipping an iced tea, he said he planned to spend 20 days year in the country, more than in any other market outside of the United States.

He didn t elaborate, so I prodded him on how he might know that to be true.  I mean, I know all the data,  he said.
