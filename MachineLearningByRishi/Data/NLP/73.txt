Why eBay s CEO sold eBay India and poured $500 million into the country s top Amazon rival: Can you explain how you went from investing in Snapdeal   and then selling most of your stake in them   to investing in one of its biggest competitors, Flipkart  Devin Wenig: The process started almost a year ago with us looking at the Indian market and seeing who was winning and who was losing and what the next few years were going to be like. We were evaluating both eBay India and Snapdeal. And what was the conclusion  I ll start by saying I really do believe the market will be a strong commerce market. There are just too many positive dynamics: Too much growing wealth, too much tech adoption, too much demand for goods and supply-demand imbalance. It s also true that the market has been overheated, not rational, and probably over-invested in too many companies. It s been a very unhealthy e-commerce dynamic for a few years. The conclusion was, it was going to have to consolidate, that fewer parties were probably a good thing for the market. Flipkart had a very strong close to last year and they are starting to pull away. So if we are serious about the market, I want to invest in   and be partners with   those that are going to win. The conclusion was there weren t going to be 10 winners, but maybe only one or two. And Flipkart   given all of that   was the natural party to align with. How concerned are you about how unprofitable all the companies in this market are  Consolidation in the market is healthy and we believe Flipkart will do what it takes to build a long-term business. But long term might be long term. It might take more money and more time. Am I concerned about it  Yeah, of course. But we think that these moves in the market make it much more likely that in a reasonable time frame and investment, they will get to a profitable scale.
