Why do developers who could work anywhere flock to the world s most expensive cities  I believe there s a more fundamental economic divide opening than the one between haves and have-nots. I think we are witnessing a growing rift between the world s Extremistan cities, in which truly extraordinary things can be achieved, and its Mediocristan towns, in which you van work and make money and be happy but never achieve greatness. (Labels stolen from the great Nassim Taleb) The arts have long had Extremistan cities. That s why aspiring writers move to New York City, and even directors and actors who found international success are still drawn to L.A. like moths to a klieg light. Now it is true of tech too. Even if you don t even want to try to (help) build something extraordinary   and the startup myth is so powerful today that it s a very rare engineer indeed who hasn t at least dreamed about it   the prospect of being where great things happen is intoxicatingly enticing. But the interesting thing about this is that it could, in theory, change; because   as of quite recently   distributed, decentralized teams can, in fact, achieve extraordinary things. The cards are arguably stacked against them, because VCs tend to be quite myopic. But no law dictates that unicorns may only be born in California, and a handful of other secondary territories; and it seems likely that, for better or worse, Extremistan is spreading. It would be pleasantly paradoxical if that expansion ultimately leads to lower rents in the Mission.
