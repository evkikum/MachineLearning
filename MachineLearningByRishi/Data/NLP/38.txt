Why did ESPN let go of 100 of its writers, reporters and on-air staff today  The programmer, which has around 8,000 employees, says it s making the moves as it adapts its mix of TV and digital programming to the Twitter/Facebook/Snapchat age. Its content costs are rising as it pays ever-increasing fees for rights to show college and pro sports. But its subscriber base is shrinking as pay TV customers cut the cord or never sign up for it in the first place. The short version of his answer: ESPN thinks it will continue to grow its subscriber revenue by charging its remaining subscribers (via pay TV distributors) more for the service, and that it can keep growing ad rates, too. But ESPN can t simply grow its way out of this problem. It will have to cut costs, too.
