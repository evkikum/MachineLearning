BlackBerry Jumps as $814.9 Million Qualcomm Refund Bolsters Cash: BlackBerry Ltd. stock rose the most in more than two years after it was awarded $814.9 million to end a dispute with Qualcomm Inc. over royalty payments, giving it cash needed to help recast itself as a software maker. The two companies had agreed to enter binding arbitration to settle claims by BlackBerry that it was owed refunds on technology licensing fees prepaid to the chipmaker. The announcement sent BlackBerry shares up as much as 19 percent in New York, the most intraday since January 2015. The refund from Qualcomm will boost BlackBerry s cash hoard, which stood at $1.7 billion at the end of its fiscal fourth quarter, helping Chief Executive Officer John Chen as he spends more money to shift the company s focus to software and security-focused products. BlackBerry no longer makes the phones that used Qualcomm technology and arguedthat it was due a refund after sales collapsed.
