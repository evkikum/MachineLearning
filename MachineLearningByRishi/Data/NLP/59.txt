How Infosys s $20 billion revenue target by 2020-21 is hurting the firm: Infosys Ltd, despite a relatively good performance over the past two years, is battling perceptions of under-performance because of its inability to keep pace with its ambitious target of more than doubling its revenue to $20 billion by March 2021. This target appears to have done more harm than good: analysts continue to rate the company using it as a metric; and people in the know attribute the departure of at least a few senior executives over the past few years to it. Now, an analyst at a foreign brokerage has suggested that the company is better off without the target.  Management continues to maintain  aspirational  revenue and margin targets that are increasingly becoming unlikely to be achieved, in our opinion. Given Infy (Infosys) is now guiding to lower levels of both revenue growth and margins in FY18 (2017-18), we think management would be well-served to either amend or drop its aspirational targets,  Keith Bachman, an analyst with BMO Capital Markets, wrote in a note dated 16 April. Since outlining this target, Sikka steered Infosys to dollar revenue growth of 9.1% in 2015-16 and 7.4% in 2016-17; for the second consecutive year, Infosys will grow faster than its larger rival Tata Consultancy Services Ltd (TCS) and cross-town peer Wipro Ltd (Wipro). Still, Infosys continues to be evaluated on the progress it makes in becoming a $20 billion company. Worryingly for the management, a bigger fallout of the targets has been the pressure on senior leaders, making a few of them leave. Since April 2015, half-a-dozen executive vice-presidents (EVPs) and a dozen senior vice-presidents (SVPs) have quit. Not all departures are on account of the targets but two former executives admit that they left Infosys as they could not keep up with the  impossible targets.
