Amazon AWS S3 outage is breaking things for a lot of websites and apps: Amazon s S3 web-based storage service is experiencing widespread issues, leading to service that s either partially or fully broken on websites, apps and devices upon which it relies. The AWS offering provides hosting for images for a lot of sites, and also hosts entire websites, and app backends including Nest. The S3 outage is due to  high error rates with S3 in US-EAST-1,  according to Amazon s AWS service health dashboard, which is where the company also says it s working on  remediating the issue,  without initially revealing any further details. Affected websites and services include Quora, newsletter provider Sailthru, Business Insider, Giphy, image hosting at a number of publisher websites, filesharing in Slack, and many more. Connected lightbulbs, thermostats and other IoT hardware is also being impacted, with many unable to control these devices as a result of the outage. Amazon S3 is used by around 148,213 websites, and 121,761 unique domains, according to data tracked by SimilarTech, and its popularity as a content host concentrates specifically in the U.S. It s used by 0.8 percent of the top 1 million websites, which is actually quite a bit smaller than CloudFlare, which is used by 6.2 percent of the top 1 million websites globally   and yet it s still having this much of an effect.
