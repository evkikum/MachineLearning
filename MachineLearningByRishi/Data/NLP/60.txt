Uber's revenue hits $6.5 billion in 2016, still has large loss: Ride-hailing service Uber Technologies  generated $6.5 billion in revenue last year and its gross bookings doubled to $20 billion, the company said on Friday. Its adjusted net loss was $2.8 billion, excluding the operation in China it sold last year, Uber said. As a private company, now worth $68 billion, Uber does not report its financial results publicly. It confirmed the figures in an emailed statement after Bloomberg reported the results. For the final quarter of 2016, gross bookings increased 28 percent from the previous quarter, to $6.9 billion. But Uber's losses grew to $991 million in the period, as revenues grew 74 percent to $2.9 billion from the third quarter.
