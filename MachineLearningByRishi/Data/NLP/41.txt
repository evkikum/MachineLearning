PayPal offers positive outlook, beats expectations: PayPal Holdings raised its earnings outlook on Wednesday after reporting higher-than-expected quarterly profit resulting from an increase in payment processing volumes and user growth. The company raised its full-year profit forecast to $1.28-$1.33 per share from $1.26-$1.31, and said its board authorized a $5 billion share buyback program. Revenue rose 17 percent to $2.98 billion, beating analysts' average estimate of $2.94 billion. Chief Financial Officer John Rainey said the company was planning some staff cuts and other restructuring initiatives which will slash $75 million in annual costs. "Less than 3 percent of our global workforce will be affected and based on current plans, we do not expect a net decrease in headcount for the year," Rainey said. PayPal's shares jumped 6 percent to $47.08 in after-hours trading.
