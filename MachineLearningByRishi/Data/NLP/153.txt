Drone startup Lily filed for bankruptcy as pre-order customers await their refunds: The Lily drone was supposed to ship by now, but the company shut down in January before ever delivering a single one of its hyped drones to any of the over 61,000 people who pre-ordered one. Following a lawsuit by the San Francisco District Attorney charging the company of misleading business practices, as well as a raid by federal agents, the now defunct drone company filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection Monday in Delaware. In 2015 and 2016, Lily had amassed $34.8 million in pre-sales for its drone and received $15 million in investment from some of Silicon Valley s most high profile firms, including Spark Capital, SV Angel, High Line Venture Partners, Slow Ventures and Sherpa Capital. According to its bankruptcy filing, Lily plans to issue refunds and auction off its intellectual property. Though many pre-sale customers report having received their money back, dozens have emailed or called me in the past month complaining that they have yet to receive their refund despite repeated attempts to contact the company.  I have tried emailing the company multiple times with no response,  complained one pre-order customer last week. Lily was able to attract so many customers thanks to a highly produced video showcasing the product that went viral in 2015, but according to the lawsuit from the district attorney s office, the footage that was supposed to be from the Lily drone in the promotional video wasn t real. Rather it was captured with a  GoPro mounted to a Lily prototype,  wrote Lily CEO Antoine Balaresque in an email obtained by the district attorney.  I am worried that a lens geek could study our images up close and detect the unique GoPro lens footprint. But I am just speculating here: I don't know much about lenses but I think we should be extremely careful if we decide to lie publicly,  Balaresque wrote in another email to the producer of the video.
