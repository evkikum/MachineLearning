Pinterest users can now jump to other products within an image: The company today said it s launching a new feature that allows users to find and jump to additional products within a photo they re currently viewing. So, for example, if a search for a jacket brings up an image of someone wearing that jacket, Pinterest will also identify other products like the jeans and shoes they re wearing. That means that if a business is trying to show off their products, users will have yet another way to jump to similar products they re showing on Pinterest. All this is a result of the company s major investments in image search. Pinterest has largely built a name for itself because of its strong image search capabilities, and that thus far has been its selling point for advertisers. While companies like Google can capture the intent of a user directly searching for a product, Pinterest also taps into moments where potential customers are just meandering around and might stumble onto a product they may later buy. The act of saving that can also signal an intent to advertisers for a purchase, which is yet another touchpoint for those marketers to convert them into a sale.
