Pandora is in trouble, and Big Music is surprisingly sad about that: Pandora s days seem numbered. And the music business isn t happy about that. Pandora, once a music streaming pioneer, now looks like a music streaming casualty. While competitors like Spotify and Apple Music are booming, Pandora has been treading water. Pandora s management is under investor pressure, yet again, to explain why they shouldn t sell the company. Sirius XM remains, as always, the logical buyer. The new, new thing is that Big Music   the music labels and publishers that dominate the industry   aren t gleeful about that prospect. That s a change from years past, when Pandora was the company the music guys loved to hate, because Pandora had figured out how to build a big streaming music service without charging for music, and without making deals with Big Music. Instead, Pandora took advantage of U.S. copyright rules that let them pay a set price for each song they streamed, without ever negotiating with the labels and without ever charging consumers. You will not be surprised to know that the Big Music guys argued that Pandora built a multi-billion dollar business with their stuff without giving them their proper cut. But that was then! Now, things are different in two significant ways: Pandora ended up negotiating licenses directly with the big guys. Pandora now plans to launch a subscription service, which will mirror the ones sold by the likes of Spotify and Apple Music.  They ve seen the light,  said a Big Music executive, explaining why the industry would like to see Pandora stay afloat.
