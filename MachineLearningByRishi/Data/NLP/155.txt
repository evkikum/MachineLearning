Angry Birds-dependent games maker Rovio swings to annual profit: innish mobile games and animation studio Rovio Entertainment swung to an annual profit in 2016 as its Angry Birds movie release helped boost its game sales and tackle competition from new challengers such as Nintendo Co's Pokemon GO. However, analysts noted the private-held company must find new franchises and reduce its dependence on the Angry Birds brand to succeed in the highly competitive game industry. Following years of falling earnings, job cuts and divestments, Rovio's revenue increased 34 percent in 2016 to 190 million euros ($201 million). The operating result improved to a profit of 17.5 million euros from a loss of 21 million in 2015.
